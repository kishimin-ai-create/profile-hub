# Daybook

Daybook is a full-stack diary application built with a Hono + TypeScript backend and a Next.js +
React frontend. The repository also includes product requirements, technical specifications, and
agent-oriented review guidance for development workflows.

## Demo

The repository does not include a screen recording yet, but the core user flow is designed around
the following experience:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Visitor[Visitor] --> List[Diary List]
  List --> Detail[Diary Detail]
  Admin[Administrator] --> Login[Login]
  Login --> Dashboard[Admin Dashboard]
  Dashboard --> Create[Create Diary]
  Dashboard --> Edit[Edit Diary]
  Dashboard --> Delete[Delete Diary]
```

## Features

- Public diary browsing with list and detail views
- Administrator-only create, edit, and delete flows
- Japanese / English i18n-ready UI design
- Requirements and specification documents under `docs/`
- Agent-based review workflow using `.github/agents/` and `agents/`

## Installation

Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

```bash

```

## Usage

Start the backend and frontend in separate terminals:

Then open the frontend in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Note

  `.github/agents/CodeReviewAgent.agent.md`.
- Add a demo video, screenshots, or architecture diagrams if the repository is going to be shared
  more broadly.
